👋 Hi, I’m @seemedidemees
👀 I’m interested in all things quantum!
🌱 I’m currently working with Google's Cirq framework
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on natural language processing with a focus on communication optimization throughout Space and earning a career in quantum chemical manufacturing vis-à-vis quantum communications.
📫 You can reach me at clevonwarner96@gmail.com [dev-discussions] or clevonwarner@outlook.com [career-opportunity].

My background is in Chemistry and I've worked in testing and analytics for two years. In my spare time I've researched quantum computing, information theory and radiation and I believe it is possible to generate strategic elemnts in our planetary environments for information and material transport. Given the proper positioning of off Earth assets, particularly our solar sails, the energy they collect may be reorganized into structure and those structures transported and organized at other locations.

Transition metals, inert gases, radioactive elements and subatomic particles are most important to study in interstellar|controlled nuclear fissions & fusion via solar power.
